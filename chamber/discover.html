                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>In Yoruba mythology, Olodumare instructed Obatala to create the earth, but he became drunk on palm
                    wine. Oduduwa then took over the task, descended from the heavens, and formed land by dropping earth
                    on the ocean, creating a mound called Oke Ora.<br>
                    <br>He placed a five-toed cockerel on it to spread the
                    soil and planted a palm nut, from which a tree with sixteen branches grew, symbolizing the founding
                    clans of Ile Ife. This act sparked a lasting rivalry between Oduduwa and Obatala, still reflected in
                    the Itapa festival today.<br>
                    <br>Oduduwa is honored as the ancestor of Yoruba kings, while Obatala is
                    credited with creating the first humans. “Ile Ife” means “The Home of Expansion”.

                <h3>Demographics</h3>
                <p>Ilé-Ifẹ̀, also known as Ifẹ̀, is an ancient Yoruba city located in southwestern Nigeria, within Osun
                    State, approximately 218 kilometers northeast of Lagos.<br>
                    <br>Believed to have been founded between 1000BC and 500 BC, it became a major cultural and
                    religious center by 900 AD and is considered the
                    spiritual heart of the Yoruba civilization. According to the 2006 census, Ilé-Ifẹ̀ has a population
                    of over 500,000, making it the most populous city in Osun State.<br>
                    <br>The current Ọọ̀ni of Ifẹ̀, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, has ruled since 2015. Known as
                    the “City of 401 Orisha (deities),” Ilé-Ifẹ̀ remains a vibrant center for traditional worship, with
                    frequent festivals celebrating its many spiritual figures.<br>
                    <br>The city is also globally renowned for its ancient bronze, stone, and terracotta sculptures,
                    dating from 1200 to 1400 CE, reflecting its rich artistic heritage.
